# Automatic Image Colorization App

This project is a **Streamlit web application** for automatic colorization of grayscale images using a deep learning model. The app allows users to upload a grayscale image and view its colorized version side-by-side, leveraging a PyTorch-based neural network.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Upload grayscale images (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`)
- View original and colorized images side-by-side
- Simple, responsive UI built with Streamlit
- Modular code structure for easy extension

## üß† Model Overview

The colorization model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) inspired by the [‚ÄúColorful Image Colorization‚Äù](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08511) paper. It takes a single-channel (L) grayscale image and predicts the two color channels (a, b) in the LAB color space.

## üèãÔ∏è Model Training (Summary)

1. **Dataset:**  
   Use a dataset like [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/) or [COCO](https://cocodataset.org/) with color images.

2. **Preprocessing:**  
   - Convert images to LAB color space.
   - Use the L channel as input, ab channels as targets.

3. **Training Loop:**  
   - Model: Custom CNN (`ColorizationNet`)
   - Loss: MSE or cross-entropy on ab channels
   - Optimizer: Adam or SGD

4. **Saving Weights:**  
   - Save the trained model as `colorization_model.pth` in `app/model/`.

> **Note:** The provided app expects a pre-trained model. Training code is not included but can be added if needed.
